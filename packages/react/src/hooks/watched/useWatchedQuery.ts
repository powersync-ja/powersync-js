   * The `updateSettings` method is asynchronous, thus it will update the state asynchronously.
   * In the React hooks we'd like to report that we are fetching the data for an updated query
   * as soon as the query has been updated. This prevents a result flow where e.g. the hook:
   *  - already returned a result: isLoading, isFetching are both false
   *  - the query is updated, but the state is still isFetching=false from the previous state
   * We override the isFetching status while the `updateSettings` method is running (if we report `isFetching`),
   * we override this value just until the `updateSettings` method itself will update the `isFetching` status.
   * We achieve this by registering a `settingsWillUpdate` listener on the `WatchedQuery`. This will fire
   * just before the `isFetching` status is updated.
