# PowerSync SDK for Web

_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL on the server-side._

This package (`packages/web`) is the PowerSync SDK for JavaScript Web clients. It is an extension of `packages/common`.

See a summary of features [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/js-web).

# Installation

## Install Package

```bash
npm install @powersync/web
```

## Install Peer Dependency: WA-SQLite

This SDK currently requires `@journeyapps/wa-sqlite` as a peer dependency.

Install it in your app with:

```bash
npm install @journeyapps/wa-sqlite
```

### Encryption with Multiple Ciphers

To enable encryption you need to specify an encryption key when instantiating the PowerSync database.

> The PowerSync Web SDK uses the ChaCha20 cipher algorithm by [default](https://utelle.github.io/SQLite3MultipleCiphers/docs/ciphers/cipher_chacha20/).

```typescript
export const db = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  // The schema you defined
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: {
    // Filename for the SQLite database â€” it's important to only instantiate one instance per file.
    dbFilename: 'example.db'
    // Optional. Directory where the database file is located.'
    // dbLocation: 'path/to/directory'
  },
  // Encryption key for the database.
  encryptionKey: 'your-encryption-key'
});

// If you are using a custom WASQLiteOpenFactory or WASQLiteDBAdapter, you need specify the encryption key inside the construtor
export const db = new PowerSyncDatabase({
  schema: AppSchema,
  database: new WASQLiteOpenFactory({
    //new WASQLiteDBAdapter
    dbFilename: 'example.db',
    vfs: WASQLiteVFS.OPFSCoopSyncVFS,
    // Encryption key for the database.
    encryptionKey: 'your-encryption-key'
  })
});
```

# Getting Started

Our [full SDK reference](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/js-web) contains everything you need to know to get started implementing PowerSync in your project.

# Public Workers

For some frameworks, it may be required to configure the web workers ([see the docs](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/react-native-and-expo/react-native-web-support)).
The `@powersync/web` package includes a CLI utility which can copy the required assets to the `public` directory (configurable with the `--output` option).

```bash
pnpm powersync-web copy-assets
```
