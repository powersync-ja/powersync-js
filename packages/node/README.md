# PowerSync SDK for Node.js

_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL on the server-side._

This package (`packages/node`) is the PowerSync SDK for Node.js clients. It is an extension of `packages/common`.
Using this package is not necessary for PowerSync on servers, see [our documentation](https://docs.powersync.com/installation/app-backend-setup) for more details on that.

See a summary of features [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/node).

## Alpha Release

The `@powersync/node` package is currently in an Alpha release.

# Installation

## Install Package

```bash
npm install @powersync/node
```

Both `@powersync/node` and the `better-sqlite3` packages have install scripts that need to run to compile
or download sqlite3 and PowerSync binaries.

# Getting Started

The [Node.js SDK reference](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/node)
contains everything you need to know to get started implementing PowerSync in your project.

# Examples

A simple example using `@powersync/node` is available in the [`demos/example-node/`](../demos/example-node) directory.
