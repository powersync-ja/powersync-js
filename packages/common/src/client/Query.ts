   * The difference between the current and previous result set is computed.
   * The watched query will not emit changes if the result set is identical to the previous result set.
   *
   * If the result set is different, the watched query will emit the new result set and emit a detailed diff of the changes via the `onData` and `onDiff` listeners.
   *
   * The deep differentiation allows maintaining result set object references between result emissions.
   * The {@link DifferentialWatchedQuery#state} `data` array will contain the previous row references for unchanged rows.

   * @example
   * ```javascript
   * const watchedLists = powerSync.query({sql: 'SELECT * FROM lists'})
   *  .differentialWatch();
