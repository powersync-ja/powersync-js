Add experimental support for raw tables, giving you full control over the table structure to sync into.
While PowerSync manages tables as JSON views by default, raw tables have to be created by the application
developer.

For more information about raw tables, see [the documentation](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/raw-tables).
