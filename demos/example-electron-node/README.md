# PowerSync + Electron in main process

This example shows how the [PowerSync Node.js client SDK](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/node) can be used in the main process of an Electron app.

The purpose of this example is to highlight specific build configurations that enable this setup.
In particular:

1. In `src/main/index.ts`, a `PowerSyncDatabase` is created. PowerSync uses node workers to speed up database
   queries. This worker is part of the `@powersync/node` package and wouldn't be copied into the resulting Electron
   app by default. For this reason, this example has its own `src/main/worker.ts` loaded with `new URL('./worker.ts', import.meta.url)`.
2. In addition to the worker, PowerSync requires access to a SQLite extension providing sync functionality.
   This file is also part of the `@powersync/node` package and called `powersync.dll`, `libpowersync.dylib` or
   `libpowersync.so` depending on the operating system.
   We use the `copy-webpack-plugin` package to make sure a copy of that file is available to the main process,
   and load it in the custom `src/main/worker.ts`.
3. The `get()` and `getAll()` methods are exposed to the renderer process with an IPC channel.

To see it in action:

1. Make sure to run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build:packages` in the root directory of this repo.
2. Copy `.env.local.template` to `.env.local`, and complete the environment variables. You can generate a [temporary development token](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens), or leave blank to test with local-only data.
   The example works with the schema from the [PowerSync + Supabase tutorial](https://docs.powersync.com/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync#supabase-powersync).
3. `cd` into this directory. In this mono-repo, you'll have to run `./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild` once to make sure `@powersync/better-sqlite3` was compiled with Electron's toolchain.
3. Finally, run `pnpm start`.

Apart from the build setup, this example is purposefully kept simple.
To make sure PowerSync is working, you can run `await powersync.get('SELECT powersync_rs_version()');` in the DevTools
console. A result from that query implies that the PowerSync was properly configured.

For more details, see the documentation for [the PowerSync node package](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/node) and check other examples:

- [example-node](../example-node/): A Node.js CLI example that connects to PowerSync to run auto-updating queries.
- [example-electron](../example-electron/): An Electron example that runs PowerSync in the render process instead of in the main one.
