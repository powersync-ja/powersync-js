# PowerSync + Supabase Web Demo: Todo List

## Overview

Demo app demonstrating use of the [PowerSync SDK for Web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/web) together with Supabase.

A step-by-step guide on Supabase<>PowerSync integration is available [here](https://docs.powersync.com/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync).

## Getting Started

In the repo directory, use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:packages
```

Then switch into the demo's directory:

```bash
cd demos/react-supabase-todolist
```

Set up the Environment variables: Copy the `.env.local.template` file:

```bash
cp .env.local.template .env.local
```

And then edit `.env.local` to insert your credentials for Supabase.

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

This demo is PWA compatible, and works fully offline. PWA is not available in development (watch) mode. The manifest and service worker is built using [vite-plugin-pwa](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/).

Build the production codebase:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Run the production server:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Open a browser on the served URL and install the PWA.
