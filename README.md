## Tools

- [tools/diagnostics-app](./tools/diagnostics-app): A standalone web app that presents stats about a user's local database (incl. tables and sync buckets).

# Development

This monorepo uses pnpm.

Install workspace dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build packages

```bash
pnpm build:packages
```

## Tests

Some packages use [Playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright) for testing. Install Playwright dependencies with:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install-deps
pnpm exec playwright install
```

## Versioning

### Development Packages

Development packages can be published by manually triggering the `dev-packages` workflow. Development packages are versioned as `0.0.0-{tag}-DATETIMESTAMP`.

### Production Packages

Pull requests should contain Changesets for changed packages.

Add changesets with

```Bash
pnpm changeset add
```

Merging a PR with Changesets will automatically create a PR with version bumps. That PR will be merged when releasing.

## React Native Quick SQLite Development

The PowerSync React Native SDK uses [a fork of react-native-quick-sqlite](https://github.com/powersync-ja/react-native-quick-sqlite)

Testing live development changes to `@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite` will not work with standard `yarn link` commands. Metro does not work well with symlinks <https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/286>.

The process of releasing development packages for `@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite` for each change can be tedious and slow. A faster (and hackier) method is to use [mtsl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mtsl) which will watch and copy the package into this workspace's `node_modules`.

```bash
npm install -g mtsl
```

```bash
mtsl add -s "[source path to your react-native-quick-sqlite repo folder]" -d "[this workspaces root node_modules folder]"/@journeyapps/react-native-quick-sqlite
```

```bash
mtsl start "[the id returned from step above]"
```
