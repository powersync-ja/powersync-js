# Diagnostics app

This diagnostics app presents data from the perspective of a specific user (no server-side stats) and can be used to:

- See stats about the user's local database.
- Inspect tables and sync buckets on the device.
- Get started quickly - play around with a SQLite database without creating an app.
- Serve as a baseline to compare your own apps against if you run into issues.

The app is currently available at [https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com/](https://diagnostics-app.powersync.com/)

It can also be run as a local standalone web app, and is largely based on the [web SDK](/packages/web/).

## Running the app with Docker

```sh
docker run --pull always -p 8082:80 journeyapps/powersync-diagnostics-app
```

The app will be available on http://localhost:8082.

## Running the app locally

In the root of the repository, run:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build:packages
```

Then in this directory run:

```
pnpm dev
```

The app is now available on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## Sign in

Signing in as a user requires a PowerSync Token (JWT) and Endpoint.

**PowerSync Token**:

Generate a [development token](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/installation/authentication-setup/development-tokens) for the user.

**PowerSync Endpoint**: For PowerSync development tokens, the endpoint should be populated automatically. For other JWTs, e.g. Supabase tokens, it needs to be entered manually. For PowerSync Cloud, this is your instance URL. For self-hosted setups (running the PowerSync service inside Docker) the returned instance URL is internal to the Docker network and will be unreachable outside of it. Since we run the diagnostics app outside of docker, you can then connect to the endpoint as exposed by docker-proxy, e.g. `http://localhost:8080`.

## Functionality

### Database stats

Details about the user's local database:

### Detected tables

This only includes tables with synced data (tables with 0 synced rows won’t be present):

### Sync buckets

![](public/images/diagnostics-app-buckets.png)

Similar to tables above, this only includes buckets with synced data.
When syncing large amounts of data:

- Total operations is calculated from the checkpoint, will be populated quickly.
- Other stats are populated as the data is downloaded, so this may take a while.

### SQL console

Same functionality as in the other demo apps:

### Dynamic schema [internal]

The schema is required for some functionality, and is dynamically generated and automatically updated from downloaded data. The schema used is displayed in a separate page:

![](public/images/diagnostics-app-schema.png)

If a table has 0 synced rows, it won’t be present in the schema, and queries referencing it will fail.

Tables and columns are only added to this schema - nothing is automatically removed when removed from sync rules. To refresh the schema, use the “Clear & Redownload” button on the main page.

## Known issues

At this stage, we recommend running the app with the dev console open, as some errors are currently not being surfaced to the UI.

Other known issues:

- Having the app open in multiple tabs may cause issues.
- When a lot of data is synced, the main dashboard may be slow.
